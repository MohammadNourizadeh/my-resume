            <span>about me</span>

            I'm a frontend developer with experience in building modern and practical user interfaces using React and JavaScript. <br /> I'm comfortable working with state management tools like Redux and Redux Toolkit, and I'm familiar with modern development approaches used across different projects.
            Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code is important to me. <br /> I'm also familiar with C and SQL, which have helped me gain a better understanding of core programming concepts and working with databases.
            Staying up to date with new technologies is a key part of my professional growth. In every project, I strive to strike a balance between simplicity, performance, and a great user experience.
